Will Pickard
Project 4
Eileen Kramer

The project, completely completed, was first turned in on 05/05/2014 before midnight.
I was told that we had til 3PM today, 05/06/2014 to submit them, so I went back and added some things for fun.

ADDED:

1) Added an array of Entity sets to act as state memory for each step in the simulation
2) Added a small menu that allows the user to select between 3 options at the simulations completion
	0: deallocate all memory allocated on heap and exit
	1: Get the difference in each entity from step 1 to step 100
	2: Print the state at a specific step, state being the state of each entity in the simulation's entity step
3) In order to manage memory, I had to create a cloning method for Seller, Buyer, and Retailer. This is simply called clone. It is virtual and allows me to 
create duplicate an object's state and put it on the heap. These duplicates are also deallocated when the user selects 0 in the menu


Please keep in mind that I went above and beyond just for the sake of it. I know this is being turned in slightly late, but I did already turn in a complete Prject4. I hope no points will be taken off because I decided to have a little fun and practice copy constructors with polymorphism
